Details: This SQL query retrieves information about penalties and payments for each member. It counts the total number of penalties incurred (COUNT(p.bid)), the number of penalties that have been paid (COUNT(CASE WHEN p.paid_amount >= p.amount THEN p.bid END)), and calculates the total dollar amount of paid penalties (SUM(CASE WHEN p.paid_amount >= p.amount THEN p.paid_amount ELSE 0 END)), ensuring that only paid penalties are considered. The IFNULL function is used to handle cases where there are no paid penalties, ensuring that the total paid amount is 0. The results are grouped by the member's email address.
